### Advanced Tables
Extended table functionality like moving between cells via `TAB`.
### Commander
Allows for commands (_default: `CTRL+P`_) to be places in different locations of the interface like the sidebar, the ribbon, etc. This has no functionality by default and needs to be customized to the projects needs and usage behaviour.
### Dataview
A powerful data query plugin that enables the display of data in many different ways. It can be used for listing all code references, for tables of contents, and more.

### Excalidraw
Plugin for creating drawings, sketches, complex mindmaps and handwritten notes inside Obsidian, that features linking, file embedding and stylus support.

It has some overlap with the native plugin **Canvas**, that itself is very useful. Which to use is dependant on use case and preference.

### Kanban
Kanban-functionality inside Obsidian, which allows linking to other notes. Alternatively you can use [Obsidian Trello](https://github.com/nathonius/obsidian-trello) to connect and sync Obsidian with Trello.

### Outliner
Extended features for lists like drag-and-drop.

### Templater
A template plugin that is widely more powerful than the native **Templates** plugin. For example it allows parsing specific data like note names or the current date when creating a note from a template.

### Various Complements
Introduces IDE-style autocomplete when writing. It can be configured to suggest words from the same note or the entire vault and more, but by default it will only autocomplete links. How links are inserted can also be customized.
